<h5><div style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', serif;">:: the meantime</h5>
<i>[n.] "the moment of realization that your quintessential future self isnâ€™t ever going to show up, which forces the role to fall upon the understudy, the gawky kid for whom nothing is easy, who spent years mouthing their lines in the wings before being shoved into the glare of your life, which is already well into its second act."</i>
